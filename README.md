# kofi-darkmode
A community contributed dark theme for Ko-fi

Kofi Dark mode is maintained by members who are willing to contribute to the project

# Notes
- Follow suggestions in newsfeed have a weird box shadow, especially on hover. Ref: `.kfds-hz-follow-suggestion-box`
- Colors should be organized with variables instead of figuring out what color looks nice
- Some colers may not show properly if the ko-fi user has a customized color theme. There is no way around this unless there is a variable for the user's custom color.
